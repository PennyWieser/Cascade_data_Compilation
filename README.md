# Cascade_data_Compilation
This repository contains the compiled data and Jupyter Notebooks used for plotting and calculations for the paper 
'Geophysical and Geochemical Constraints on Magma Storage depths along the Cascade Arc: Knowns and Unknowns

The key folders are
----------------------------
Stitching_Mineral_Data - This contains mineral data for each volcano, and the Jupyter notebooks used to stitching the data together, and calculating P 
Topographic_Profiles - Contains a xlsx file of the topographic data for each volcano, and the notebook used to make the topography outlines for the figures. qGIS profiles show Lat and long of each point on the transect given, in addition to elevation
Summary_For_Each_Volcano - There is a folder for each volcano that contains the jupyter notebooks used to make the summary plots. Has a subfolder 'Along arc trends' for the summary figures
CHOMPI_Assesment - Our assesment of the CHOMPI barometer

The key datasets are
----------------------------
'All_data_merged.xlsx' - All the mineral and melt inclusion compositions used in this study, and the geophysical compilation

'Cascade_seismic_stations.xlsx' - Lat, long, dates and types of seismic stations for each volcano
