# Cascade_data_Compilation
This repository contains the compiled data and Jupyter Notebooks used for plotting and calculations for the paper 
'Geophysical and Geochemical Constraints on Magma Storage depths along the Cascade Arc: Knowns and Unknowns

The key datasets are:
'All_data_merged.xlsx' - All the mineral and melt inclusion compositions used in this study

'Cascade_seismic_stations.xlsx' - Lat, long, dates and types of seismic stations for each volcano

The following folders contain other data and notebooks used during this study

'Topographic_profiles': qGIS profiles across each volcano shown in each figure. Lat and long of each point on the transect given, in addition to elevatoin

'Summary_For_Each_Volcano': Folder for each volcano that makes all the relevant figures shown in the main text. Also has a subfolder 'Along arc trends' for the summary figures

'Stiching_Mineral_Data': This contains the compiled mineral data for each volcano, as well as Jupyter notebooks used to filter the data, and calculations for P
